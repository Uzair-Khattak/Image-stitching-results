# Image-Stitching-Results

Hello everyone, in this repository we have for now only shared the results of our stitching algorithm which is implemented in Python. We used the same dataset for Microsoft ICE (Image composite editor) and compared our results with ICE results. There is a color degradation issue (sharp colour variance) in ICE which does not appear in our images.

--> Code and complete results will be published soon !!
